## Description

This example design demonstrates QR decomposition of matrices (complex numbers), a common operation employed in linear algebra. Matrix A (input) is decomposed into a product of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R.

## Building the Example Design (Linux)

1. Install the design into a directory `build` from the design directory by running `cmake`:

```
mkdir build
cd build
```

If you are compiling for the A10 PAC board, run `cmake` using the command:

```
cmake .. 
```

If instead you are compiling for the S10 PAC board, run `cmake` using the command:

```
cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following four targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

    * Compile and run for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device). This step generates a random matrix and computes QR decomposition.

       ```
       make fpga_emu
       ./qrd.fpga_emu 
       ```

    * Generate HTML performance report. Find the report in `qrd_report.prj/reports/report.html`directory.

       ```
       make report
       ``` 

    * Compile and run on an FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device). This step performs the following:
      * Generates 32768 random matrices.
      * Computes QR decomposition on all matrices. NOTE: The design has been optimized for maximum performance when running on a large number of matrices that are a power of 2.
      * Evaluates performance.

       ```
       make fpga 
       ./qrd.fpga 32768 
       ```

       For the S10 PAC board, run on the hardware with the command:
       ```
       ./qrd.fpga 40960 
       ```
       
    * Compile and run on CPU hardware (not optimized). This step generates a random matrix and computes QR decomposition.

       ```
       make cpu_host
       ./qrd.cpu_host 
       ```
3. Download the design, compiled for FPGA hardware, from this location: [download](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/others/support/examples/download/qrd.fpga)

## Building the Example Design (Windows)

Note: `cmake` is not yet supported on Windows, a build.ninja file is provided instead. 
Note: Ensure that Microsoft Visual Studio* (2019 Version 16.4 or newer) with "Desktop development with C++" workload is installed on your system.

1. Enter source file directory.

```
cd src
```

2. Compile the design. The following four targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

    * Generate HTML performance report. Find the report in `../src/qrd.prj/reports/report.html`directory.

       ```
       ninja report
       ``` 

    * **Not supported:** Compile and run for emulation.

    * **Not supported yet:** Compile and run on an FPGA hardware.

    * Compile and run on CPU hardware (not optimized). This step generates a random matrix and computes QR decomposition.

       ```
       ninja cpu_host
       ./qrd.cpu_host 
       ```

## Building the Example Design in Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this example design in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel(R) oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)

## Using the Example design
You can apply QR decomposition to a number of matrices. Invoke it as shown in the following: 

```
./qrd.fpga [<num>]
```

### Sample Output

```
Device name: pac_a10 : Intel PAC Platform (pac_f400000)
Generating 32768 random matrices
Running QR decomposition of 32768 matrices repeatedly
   Total duration:   39.5882 s
Throughput: 27.1k matrices/s
Verifying results on matrix 0 16384 32767

```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description
---        |---
| `<num>`  | Optional argument that specifies the number of matrices to decompose. Its default value is `1`.

## Backend compiler flags used when compiling the design 

| Flag | Description
---    |---
`-Xshardware` | target FPGA hardware
`-Xsclock=300MHz` | the FPGA backend attempts to achieve 300 MHz
`-Xsfp-relaxed` | allows backend to relax the order of additions 
`-Xsparallel=2` | uses 2 cores when compiling the bitstream through Quartus
`-Xsseed=2` | uses seed 2 during Quartus, yields slightly higher fmax
`-DFIXED_ITERATIONS=64` | uses the value 64 for the constant FIXED_ITERATIONS. This constant is passed to the ivdep attribute for a loop in the design.

NOTE: the Xsseed and DFIXED_ITERATIONS values differ depending on the board being targeted.
